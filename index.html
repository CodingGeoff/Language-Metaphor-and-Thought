            In this chapter, we shall examine the relationships between language and thought. You may ask: But why is
            there a “metaphor” in the title? Well, you will see that metaphor is on the one hand a language phenomenon,
            a figure of speech (<span class="chinese-term">修辞格</span>), on the other hand a cognitive device, a figure
            of thought (<span class="chinese-term">思维方式</span>). In this sense, metaphor serves as a link between

            are going to take a fresh look at the already familiar figure of speech known as “metaphor”, where we shall
            see how deeply metaphor has influenced our conceptualization of the world. Finally Section 6 gives a summary

            Have you ever considered the question what the relationship between language and thought is? Perhaps only
            occasionally. Perhaps not even once. Why? Because the question is just so fundamental and basic and appears
            to be so straightforward that we tend to take it for granted. Well, all of us can speak at least one

            live before I was born?” or “Where will I live after I die?” As we grow older, we gradually lose that
            naivety and with it goes our curiosity about the most fundamental questions of the world, life and mankind.
            One such question is the relationship between language and thought. Does language reflect our thought? Does
            language organize our thought? Does language control our thought?</p>

            data-translation-zh="几个世纪以来，一直有语言学家思考过这个问题。本杰明·李·沃尔夫便是其中之一。他将语言视为一副或多或少带有扭曲镜片的眼镜，我们通过它观察周围的环境（请注意这里运用了一个隐喻）。他对一种与英语截然不同的语言——居住在亚利桑那州的普韦布洛印第安人部落霍皮族语言的研究，使他的这一看法更加敏锐。他提出，不同的语言赋予其使用者不同的世界观，并且他观察到，英语的世界观与霍皮族的世界观在空间和时间概念化方面差异最为显著。这后来被称为<span class='knowledge-point' data-visual='whorf-hypothesis'>沃尔夫假说</span>（<span class='chinese-term'>伍尔夫假设</span>）。">
            Over the centuries there have been linguists who have pondered over this question. Among them was Benjamin
            Lee Whorf. He perceived language as a pair of glasses with more or less warped lenses through which we view
            our surroundings (notice there is a metaphor at work here). This perception was sharpened by his work with a
            language that is very different from English—that of the Hopi, a tribe of Pueblo Indians living in Arizona.
            He suggested that different languages give their speakers different world views and he observed that the
            world view of the English departs most radically from that of the Hopi in their conceptualizations of space
            and time. This has come to be referred to as the <span class="knowledge-point"
                data-visual="whorf-hypothesis">Whorf hypothesis</span> (<span class="chinese-term">伍尔夫假设</span>). (See

        <p tabindex="0"
            data-translation-zh="例如，在英语中，我们的空间概念如此普遍，以至于我们几乎能将其完全转移到时间上。结果，时间被概念化为一个维度严格有限的空间，或是在这样一个空间上的运动。我们也把时间当作一种物质，将其分割成单位并加以计数。这就是为什么我们可以说一秒、两分钟、三小时、四天、五周等等。我们还对空间和时间使用相同的介词，如 before、after、in、at、on。形容词也是如此，如 long、short、same、different、right、wrong、hard、nice、more、less 等。甚至一些名词也为空间和时间所共有。想想 stretch of time、segment of time、amount of time，你就会明白我的意思了。">
            For example, in English our concepts of space are so pervasive that we are able to transfer them almost
            totally to time. As a result, time is conceived as a space of strictly limited dimensions, or as a motion
            upon such a space. We also treat time as a mass and carve it into units and count them. That’s why we can
            say one second, two minutes, three hours, four days, five weeks, etc. We also use the same prepositions such
            as <em>before</em>, <em>after</em>, <em>in</em>, <em>at</em>, <em>on</em> for both space and time. The same
            is true with adjectives such as <em>long</em>, <em>short</em>, <em>same</em>, <em>different</em>,
            <em>right</em>, <em>wrong</em>, <em>hard</em>, <em>nice</em>, <em>more</em>, <em>less</em>, etc. Even some
            nouns are shared by space and time as well. Consider <em>stretch of time</em>, <em>segment of time</em>,
            <em>amount of time</em>, and you’ll see what I mean.

        <p tabindex="0"
            data-translation-zh="然而，根据沃尔夫的说法，这在霍皮语中几乎从未发生过，霍皮语中的时间更准确地翻译为一种“持续”。这种“持续”似乎无法用空间或运动来理解。为了用一个例子来说明英语的时间和霍皮语的“持续”之间的差异，让我们看看这个句子：“十天比九天长”。霍皮语中用持续表达同样意思的说法会类似于“第十天比第九天晚”。">
            However, according to Whorf, this is almost never done in Hopi, where time is more accurately translated as
            a kind of “duration”. This “duration” seems to be inconceivable in terms of space or motion. To illustrate
            the differences between the English time and the Hopi “duration” with one example, let’s look at the
            sentence “Ten days is longer than nine days”. The Hopi expression of the same idea in terms of duration
            would be something like “The tenth day is later than the ninth”.</p>

            data-translation-zh="沃尔夫进一步指出，近期物理学以及哲学和逻辑学中的许多难题，都是我们努力摆脱从语言中继承的世界观的结果。他甚至推测，像霍皮族那样的世界观可能比西欧语言更适合现代物理学的概念（Bolinger 1968: 253 - 255）。">
            Whorf further pointed out that much that is difficult in recent physics as well as in philosophy and logic
            has been the struggle to climb out of the way of looking at the world which we inherit from our language. He
            even surmised that a world view such as that of the Hopi might be more congenial to the concepts of modern
            physics than the languages of Western Europe (Bolinger 1968: 253 - 255).</p>

            The Whorf hypothesis has aroused a series of debate among linguists, philosophers, and anthropologists.

            Let us move on to another question which is related to the first one: What do you think is the relationship
            between language and the outside world? Does language mirror the outside world? Does language give a
            distorted picture of the outside world? Does language create the outside world? In this section, we shall
            see that the <span class="knowledge-point" data-visual="traditional-cognitive-linguistics">traditional
                linguistic approach and the modern cognitive approach</span> have provided very different answers.</p>

        <h3>The Traditional Linguistic Approach</h3>
        <p tabindex="0" data-translation-zh="首先让我们看看传统语言学对这些问题有什么看法。基本上，其主要观点可以概括为以下三点（Gardenfors 1998，第5章，第2页）：">First
            let’s see what traditional linguistics has got to say on these questions. Basically, its main tenets can be
            summarized as the following three points (Gardenfors 1998, chapter 5, p. 2):</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Meaning exists in the objective world. That is to say, the meaning of a word or expression is something
                out there in the world. It is not something created by the human mind. The meaning of an expression is
                independent of how individual users understand it. For example, the meaning of the word <em>table</em>
                exists because in the objective world there is such an entity table. How individual users use the word
                <em>table</em> will not alter its meaning.
            </li>
            <li>Language derives meaning from reference to objects in this world. That is to say, the constituents of
                the language are mapped onto the outside world. Names are mapped onto objects, verbs are mapped onto
                sets of objects or relations between objects, adjectives are mapped onto properties of objects, etc. For
                example, the name <em>book</em> refers to the concrete entity <em>book</em> in the objective world; the
                verb <em>rise</em> captures the relationship between two objects when one is moving upward and the other
                remaining static; the adjective <em>long</em> captures the property shared by objects like a road, a
                train, or a string.</li>
            <li>The main objective of linguistic research is to formulate truth conditions for the sentences in the
                language because such conditions are supposed to determine the meaning of those sentences. Take the
                sentence “The apple is red” as an example. What is left for linguists to do is to work out under which
                conditions this sentence can be judged to be true, that is, under which conditions this sentence
                describes faithfully a state of affairs that exists in the outside world. Once that is found out, the
                meaning of the sentence is clear.</li>
        </ol>
        <p tabindex="0" data-translation-zh="那么，您对这三个主张有何看法？至少乍一看，它们看起来相当有说服力，似乎抓住了我们关于语言的直觉。您能用一个图来说明传统语言学提出的这些观点吗？">
            Well, how did you like these three claims? At least at the first sight, they look rather convincing and seem
            to have captured our intuition concerning language. Can you illustrate these points made by traditional
            linguistics with a figure?</p>
        <p><strong>Figure 1 Language and the world in traditional linguistics</strong><br>
            <em>(Figure not provided in the text. The text describes it as one oval for language, another for the
                outside world, and an arrow between them showing language mirrors the world.)</em>
        </p>
        <p tabindex="0"
            data-translation-zh="总而言之，这种传统的语言学方法赋予语言和语言使用者一个相当被动的角色：一切都已存在于世界之中。人类用他们的语言所必须做的，实际上也是他们所能做的，就是尽可能地精确反映那个外部世界。">
            All in all, this traditional linguistic approach ascribes to language, and to language users, a rather
            passive role: Everything is already out there in the world. What human beings have to do, and indeed what
            they can do, with their language, is to mirror that outside world as closely as possible.</p>

        <h3>The Modern Cognitive Approach</h3>
        <p tabindex="0"
            data-translation-zh="但是人类真的如此被动吗？我们将看到，另一种方法，即现代认知方法，对语言反映什么的问题给出了一个截然不同的答案。同样，我们可以将其概括为三点（Gardenfors 1998，第5章，第3-4页）：">
            But are human beings really as passive as that? We shall see that an alternative approach, the modern
            cognitive approach, has come up with a rather different version of answer on the question what language
            reflects. Again we can summarize it along three lines (Gardenfors 1998, chapter 5, pp. 3 - 4):</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Meanings are mental entities, i.e., they are things in the head. To put it in another way, meanings are
                elements of a conceptual structure in the heads of the language users. This claim is in direct contrast
                with the claim made by traditional linguistics that meaning is something out there in the world.</li>
            <li>Language does not derive meaning from reference to objects in the outside world. Rather, language
                derives meaning from reference to a conceptualization of the world. In other words, what language
                represents is not the outside world, but a particular conceptualization of that world. Language may be
                said to represent the outside world only in an indirect way via a conceptualization.</li>
            <li>Language itself is part of the conceptual structure in the heads of the language users. It is not an
                entity with independent standing isolated from other mental faculties such as memory, perception,
                logical inferencing, etc. Rather it is intimately linked with these other mental faculties and as such
                mirrors the interplay of psychological, cultural, social, ecological, and other factors.</li>
        </ol>
        <p tabindex="0" data-translation-zh="现在您能修改图1，使其能够表示认知方法关于语言与世界关系的主要主张吗？">Now can you modify Figure 1 so that it
            can represent the main claims of the cognitive approach on the relationship between language and the world?
        </p>
        <p><em>(The text then implies a Figure 2 would represent this cognitive approach):</em><br>
            In Figure 2, the big oval on the left stands for the conceptual structure in the heads of the language
            users. Within it the small oval stands for the language faculty in the human mind. What language reflects is
            a human conceptualization of the outside world, hence the arrow pointing from language to conceptual
            structure. The oval on the right stands for the outside world. The conceptual structure is a
            conceptualization of this world. <em>(Figure not provided in the text).</em></p>
        <p tabindex="0" data-translation-zh="在传统语言学方法和现代认知方法之间，您更倾向于哪一个？或者，对于语言与外部世界的关系问题，您或许有自己的答案？">Between the
            traditional linguistic approach and the modern cognitive approach, which one do you prefer? Or perhaps you
            have got your own answers on the question concerning the relationships between language and the outside
            world?</p>

        <h2 id="section3">3. What Is the Nature of Thought? (<span class="chinese-term">思维的本质是什么?</span>)</h2>
        <p tabindex="0"
            data-translation-zh="让我们继续讨论第三个问题：思维的本质是什么？用中文来说，就是“思维的本质是什么？”这又是一个相当哲学化的问题，您可能会自言自语：嘿，我们在这里讨论语言，为什么要费心进行哲学研究呢？嗯，您会发现哲学和语言研究是密切相关的。一方面，一些有趣的语言现象——包括合作原则和言语行为理论（您可能还记得第五章的内容）——最初是由哲学家系统研究的。另一方面，语言学家在揭示人类语言奥秘方面的努力也为许多哲学问题提供了启示。每一种关于语言和思维的方法都必须以特定的哲学为指导，无论是客观主义、主观主义还是任何其他学派。">
            Let us move on to the third question: What is the nature of thought? To put it in Chinese, the question is
            <span class="chinese-term">思维的本质是什么?</span> This is again a rather philosophical question and you may be
            saying to yourself: Hey, we are talking about language here, and why shall we bother with philosophical
            investigations? Well, you will see that philosophy and language research are very much interrelated. On the
            one hand, some interesting language phenomena—including the Cooperative Principle and the speech act theory,
            which you may recall from Chapter 5—were first systematically studied by philosophers. On the other hand,
            linguists’ efforts in revealing the mysteries of human language have also shed light on a lot of
            philosophical issues. Every approach to language and thought must be guided by a particular philosophy, be
            it objectivism, subjectivism, or any other school.

        <h3>Objectivism</h3>
        <p tabindex="0" data-translation-zh="让我们从客观主义开始。它在这个问题上的主要主张可以归纳为以下三点：">Let us start with objectivism. Its main
            claims on this issue can be presented as the following three points:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Thought is abstract in the sense that it is the manipulation of abstract symbols. For example, if A is
                larger than B and B is larger than C, than A is larger than C. Symbols get their meaning via
                correspondences to entities and categories in the world. In this way, the mind can represent external
                reality and be said to “mirror nature” (Lakoff 1987: 163).</li>
            <li>Thought is “disembodied” in the sense that it exists independently of the individual doing the thinking
                and is thus not determined by his/her properties. The nature of the human body and the way it functions
                are considered as irrelevant to the objectivist account of thought. In fact thought should transcend the
                limitations of any particular kind of being. It follows from this whether the human beings have a body
                that stands upright (as we do) or whether they have a body that lies front - back (as dogs do) will not
                leave any impact on how they conceive the world.</li>
            <li>Thought is objectively true or false. It is true and accurate when it corresponds to the outside world,
                that is, when the symbols used in thought correctly correspond to entities and categories in the world
                and when the mind reproduces the logical relations that exist objectively among the entities and
                categories of entities in the world. It is false when it fails to do so (Lakoff 1987: 163).</li>

            On the basis of such considerations, experiential realism (Lakoff & Johnson 1980; Lakoff 1987; Johnson 1987)
            provides an alternative account for the nature of thought, which may be summarized as the following two
            points:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Thought is “embodied”: It is grounded in our perception and determined by the characteristics of our
                body and our social environment (Nuyts 1993). For example, our understanding of UP - DOWN is determined
                by our physical make - up on the one hand and the gravity of the earth on the other hand. We grasp this
                structure in thousands of perceptions and activities we experience every day, such as perceiving a tree,
                our felt sense of standing upright, the activity of climbing stairs, forming a mental image of a
                flagpole, measuring our own heights, and experiencing the level of water rising in the bathtub. From
                these UP - DOWN experiences, images, and perceptions emerges the UP - DOWN structure.</li>
            <li>Thought is largely imaginative, based on the principles of metaphor and metonymy, and goes far beyond
                mirroring the outer world (ibid.). For example, in saying “He seems to be in high spirits these days”,
                an abstract concept, emotions, is understood via a less abstract concept, verticality, through a
                metaphor “Happiness Is Up”. In saying “I came across quite a few new faces at the meeting”, people are
                referred to as faces through a metonymy “Face Stands for Person”.</li>

        <p tabindex="0"
            data-translation-zh="所谓范畴化，是指人们在使用语言时，必然会将周围世界中的所有实体进行分组的过程。例如，每当我们用“花”这个词来指代两种不同的花，如玫瑰和紫罗兰，或者用同一个词“高”来描述两个不同的物体，如树和旗杆时，我们都在进行范畴化行为。因为尽管两者不同（玫瑰与紫罗兰，树与旗杆），但在每种情况下都被视为相同。">
            By categorization, we refer to the process by which people, in using language, necessarily group all the
            entities in the world around them. For example, whenever we use the word <em>flower</em> to refer to two
            different flowers, such as a rose and a violet, or describe two different objects, such as a tree and a
            flagpole, by the same word <em>tall</em>, we are undertaking acts of categorization. For although different,
            the two entities (rose vs. violet and tree vs. flagpole) are regarded in each case as the same.</p>
        <p tabindex="0"

            Now why shall we bother with categorization? The reason is straightforward: Categorization is one of the
            most important cognitive activities of human beings. It is fundamental to all higher cognitive activity.
            Without categorization, we wouldn’t be able to come to terms with the world, for the input would be too
            enormous and too messy for us to handle. The essence of categorization lies in seeing sameness in
            difference.</p>
        <p tabindex="0" data-translation-zh="范畴化引发了深刻的哲学问题。关于范畴化有许多不同的解释。">Categorization has raised deep philosophical
            problems. There are many different accounts for categorization.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>At one extreme, one group of philosophers claim that sameness is merely a matter of human invention.
                That is to say, those entities which may be called flowers, or which may be described as tall, really
                have nothing in common except for the names ascribed to them by human beings.</li>
            <li>At the other extreme, another group of philosophers claim that categories like FLOWER and TALL exist
                independently of language and language users. They maintain that the words <em>flower</em> and
                <em>tall</em> merely name those categories that have already existed in the outside world prior to
                language.
            </li>
            <li>In between these two extremes, there is an alternative position which postulates that “a word and the
                range of entities to which it may refer are mediated by a mental entity, i.e., a concept” (Taylor 1995:
                ix). That is to say, it is in virtue of a speaker’s knowledge of the concepts FLOWER and TALL that
                he/she is able to categorize different entities as flowers or as being tall.</li>

        <h3>4.1 The Objectivist View of Categorization</h3>
        <p tabindex="0"
            data-translation-zh="这种范畴化方法最终可以追溯到古希腊时期，特别是亚里士多德，他区分了事物的本质和偶然属性。本质是使事物成为其自身的东西。偶然属性是偶然的特性，它们在决定事物是什么方面不起作用。引用他的一个例子：人的本质是“两足动物”（您不必同意这一点）。其他属性，如白色或黄色，文明或野蛮，都是偶然的。它们可能对某个特定个体是真实的，但在确定一个实体是否确实是人方面是无关紧要的。">
            This approach to categorization goes back ultimately to Greek antiquity, esp. to Aristotle, who
            distinguished between the essence of a thing and its accidents. The essence is that which makes a thing what
            it is. Accidents are incidental properties, which play no part in determining what a thing is. To cite one
            of his examples: The essence of man is “two - footed animal” (you don’t have to agree with this). Other
            properties, like being white or yellow, being cultured or barbarian, are accidental. They might be true of a
            certain individual, but they are irrelevant in determining whether an entity is indeed a man.</p>
        <p tabindex="0"
            data-translation-zh="几个世纪以来，这种经典的范畴化方法得到了发展和修改，但它在心理学、哲学和语言学中的主导地位很少受到挑战。其基本假设可以概括为以下四点（Taylor 1995: 23 - 24）：">
            Over the centuries this classical approach to categorization has been developed and modified, but its
            domination in psychology, philosophy, and linguistics has rarely been challenged. Its basic assumptions can
            be summarized as the following four points (Taylor 1995: 23 - 24):</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Categories are defined in terms of a conjunction of necessary and sufficient features.
                <p>It follows from this that when we assign an entity X to the category Y, we do this by checking the
                    properties of X against the set of features which together define the essence of the category Y. To
                    return to the category MAN, Aristotle singled out two defining features for it, one being [two -
                    footed], the other being [animal]. Individually, these two features are necessary for the definition
                    of the category; if either of the two is not possessed by the entity X, then X cannot be said to be
                    a member of the category MAN. Jointly, the two features are sufficient; that is to say, so long as
                    an entity exhibits each of the two, it can safely be judged as a member of the category MAN.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Features are binary.
                <p>This amounts to saying that a feature is either present or absent. It can take on only one of two
                    values, i.e., either [+] or [-]. In any given instance, a feature is either involved in the
                    definition of a category, or it is not; and an entity either possesses this feature, or it does not.
                    To take the category BOY as an example, one of its defining features is [male]. An entity is either
                    [+male] or [-male]. There can be no other possibilities.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Categories have clear boundaries.
                <p>By this we mean that an entity is either a member of a category or it is not. A category, once
                    established, divides the universe into two sets of entities—those that are members of the category,
                    and those that are not. There do not exist ambiguous cases where an entity “in a way” or “to some
                    extent” belongs to the category, but in another way does not. For example, a person is either a
                    member of the category BOY or he is not. We cannot say that by this criterion he is and by that
                    criterion he is not.</p>
            </li>
            <li>All members of a category have equal status.
                <p>This is to say that there are no degrees of membership in a category, i.e., there are no entities
                    which are better members of the category than others. All those entities which possess all the
                    defining features of a category can be judged as full members of that category; in this sense they
                    are equal to each other. And all those entities which do not possess all the defining features
                    cannot be judged as members; in this sense they are also equal to each other. According to this
                    view, we cannot say that a swallow is a better example of the category BIRD than a penguin. They are
                    just both birds.</p>

        <p tabindex="0" data-translation-zh="所有这些主张听起来都很有说服力，并且符合我们的直觉。现在让我们详细研究一下男孩和鸟的范畴。您能为它们 각각想出一套必要且充分的特征吗？">All
            these claims sound quite convincing and agree with our intuition. Now let’s investigate the categories of
            BOY and BIRD in some detail. Can you come up with a set of necessary and sufficient features for each of
            them?</p>
        <p><strong>BOY</strong></p>
        <ul class="code-example">

        <ul class="code-example">
            <li>+having wings</li>

            <li>+able to hatch eggs</li>
            <li>etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p tabindex="0" data-translation-zh="您注意到传统范畴化观点的困难了吗？是的，至少存在以下困难：">Have you noticed the difficulties with the
            traditional view of categorization? Yes, there appear to be at least the following difficulties:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>As BOY and BIRD have shown, it is sometimes impossible to list all the common properties shared by the
                members of a category.</li>
            <li>Not all the members of a category may share a set of common properties. For this let’s think of the
                category FURNITURE. An experiment by Rosch (1975) has found out that chairs, dressers, pianos, mirrors,
                televisions and even pictures can all be counted as furniture in the eyes of Americans. But it is almost
                impossible to find a property that is shared by all of them.</li>
            <li>Not all features are binary, that is to say, not all features are a matter of all or none. Take [+able
                to fly] for BIRD as an example. What about a swallow who was seriously hurt in one of its wings and can
                only fly in a very awkward way? Is it able to fly or is it not?</li>
            <li>Not all the categories have a clear - cut boundary. For example, it can be difficult to judge if a 35 -
                year - old bachelor is a boy or not.</li>
            <li>Not all members of a category have equal status. For example, a 15 - year - old unmarried boy is a
                better example of BOY than a 35 - year - old bachelor.</li>

        <h3>4.2 The Prototype Theory of Categorization (<span class="chinese-term">原型论</span>)</h3>
        <p tabindex="0"
            data-translation-zh="我们刚才回顾的经典范畴化理论的许多不足之处，路德维希·维特根斯坦在他《哲学研究》中一段经常被引用的段落中已经预见到了，他在那里讨论了如何定义“游戏”这个范畴的问题。他指出，这个范畴的各种成员，如棋盘游戏、纸牌游戏、球类游戏等，并不共享一套共同的属性，而这些属性本应能将游戏与非游戏清晰地区分开来。这一观察有两个含义。首先，范畴的边界是模糊的而不是清晰的。其次，与经典理论的预期相反，“游戏”这个范畴不是通过共享的必要和充分特征来构建的，而是通过一个纵横交错的相似性网络来构建的。这并不否认“确实存在与该范畴典型相关的属性。一些成员共享其中一些属性，另一些成员共享另一些属性。然而，没有所有成员都共有并且只为它们所共有的属性。甚至可能出现某些成员与其他成员几乎没有任何共同之处的情况。”（Taylor 1995: 38）维特根斯坦用家族相似性的隐喻来描述“游戏”的结构，“因为家庭成员之间的各种相似之处：体格、特征、眼睛颜色、步态、气质等，都以同样的方式重叠和交错”（Wittgenstein 1978: 33）。">
            Many of the inadequacies of the classical theory of categorization that we have just reviewed were
            anticipated by Ludwig Wittgenstein in a frequently quoted passage in his <em>Philosophical
                Investigations</em>, where he addressed the question of how to define the category GAME. He notes that
            the various members of this category, such as board - games, card - games, ball - games, etc., do not share
            a set of common properties on whose basis games can be clearly distinguished from non - games. This
            observation has two implications. First, the boundary of the category is fuzzy rather than clear - cut.
            Second, contrary to the expectations of the classical theory, the category GAME is not structured in terms
            of shared necessary and sufficient features, but rather by a criss - crossing network of similarities. This
            is not to deny that “there are indeed attributes typically associated with the category. Some members share
            some of these attributes, other members share other attributes. However there are no attributes common to
            all the members, and to them alone. It may even be the case that some members have practically nothing in
            common with others.” (Taylor 1995: 38) Wittgenstein used the metaphor of a family resemblance to describe
            the structure of GAME, “for the various resemblances between members of a family: build, features, color of
            eyes, gait, temperament, etc., overlap and criss - cross in the same way” (Wittgenstein 1978: 33).</p>

            data-translation-zh="这种情况绝非“游戏”这一范畴所特有。可以说，大多数范畴的结构都与此类似。基于这些观察并认识到经典理论的困难，哲学家和语言学家提出了一种关于范畴化的替代理论，称为<span class='knowledge-point' data-visual='prototype-theory'>原型理论</span>（<span class='chinese-term'>原型论</span>）。">
            This state of affairs is by no means peculiar to the category GAME. Arguably, the majority of categories are
            structured in a similar way to this. Based on these observations and recognizing the difficulties with the
            classical theory, philosophers and linguists have put forward an alternative account for categorization,
            which is termed the <span class="knowledge-point" data-visual="prototype-theory"><em>prototype
                    theory</em></span> (<span class="chinese-term">原型论</span>).</p>
        <p tabindex="0" data-translation-zh="术语“原型”可以粗略地理解为一个范畴的中心成员，或者可能是一组中心成员。原型理论的主要思想可以概括如下：">The term
            <em>prototype</em> can be roughly understood as the central member, or perhaps the cluster of central
            members, of a category. The main idea of the prototype theory can be summarized as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Categories are defined in terms of a family of resemblance rather than by means of a set of necessary
                and sufficient features.</li>
            <li>Membership in a category is determined by the perceived distance of resemblance of the entity to the
                prototype.</li>
            <li>Membership is not a matter of all or none.</li>
        </ol>

            data-translation-zh="例如，实验表明，知更鸟和松鼠被认为是与鸟类范畴的原型非常接近的。另一方面，公鸡和企鹅则被认为离原型远得多。这就解释了为什么普通语言使用者认为公鸡和企鹅不太能代表鸟的概念。中文的“鸟”范畴也是如此，其结构大致可以用下图表示。椭圆的虚线代表范畴的模糊边界。">
            For example, experiments show that robins and squirrels are conceived of as very close to the prototype for
            the category of BIRD. Cocks and penguins, on the other hand, are conceived of as much farther away from the
            prototype. That explains why the average language user considers cocks and penguins as less representative
            of the concept of being a bird. The same is true with the Chinese category 鸟, whose structure may be roughly

            Prototype categories have a flexibility, unknown to Aristotelian categories, in being able to accommodate
            new, hitherto unfamiliar data. With only Aristotelian categories at our disposal, new data would often
            demand, for their categorization, the creation of new categories, or a redefinition of existing categories.
            On the other hand, new entities and new experiences can be readily associated, perhaps as peripheral
            members, to a prototype category, without necessarily causing any fundamental restructuring of the category
            system. (Taylor 1995: 53)

            To sum up, so far in this chapter we have briefly touched upon the Whorf hypothesis concerning the
            relationship between language and thought. We have also compared the traditional approach and the modern
            cognitive approach towards the questions what language reflects, what is the nature of thought and what is
            the nature of categorization. In the following section, we are going to shift our eyes to <span

            I bet you all understand the meaning of metaphor. Yes, it refers to a figure of speech which enables us to
            talk about one thing as if it were another. For example, in Burns’ famous lyric <em>My Love Is a Red Red
                Rose</em>, the poet’s sweetheart is compared to a rose. Where do you think we are most likely to come
            across a lot of metaphors? You might say, “Well, in literary works, esp. in poems. Those writers are great
            inventors of metaphors.” Why do you think people use metaphors in their language? You might say, “Well,
            perhaps it is for some aesthetic purposes. Metaphors are a useful decorative device. They can add a lot of

            And is a younger generation really located below you? No. So what are we doing here? We are doing a
            metaphorical thinking. We are giving a non - spatial domain, that of TIME, an up - down orientation. To be
            more specific, the metaphor that is at work here is something like “Earlier in time is shang/Later in time
            is xia”. We call metaphorical thinking like this conceptual metaphors. They underlie metaphorical
            expressions which we can notice in language, although we usually remain unaware of the existence of

            have a try and see if we can indeed survive without resorting to metaphors. Let’s talk about time. To get

            The point here is once your attention is aroused, you will realize that metaphor is everywhere—not only are
            literary works full of metaphors, but our daily utterances as well. Underlying metaphorical expressions in
            our daily language, there is a huge system of conceptual metaphors which organizes our thinking. This system
            works automatically and continuously without our being aware of its existence. In this sense, we say we live
            by metaphors.</p>
        <p tabindex="0" data-translation-zh="现在这一切听起来与我们熟悉的隐喻修辞方法大相径庭。我们将这种新方法称为隐喻的认知方法。其主要观点可以概括为以下五点：">Now all this
            sounds very different from the rhetorical approach to metaphor that we are familiar with. We call this new
            approach the cognitive approach to metaphor. Its main claims can be summarized as the following five points:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Metaphor is ubiquitous.</strong> It is a prevalent phenomenon in ordinary language. Metaphor in
                literature is not a distinctly different phenomenon from metaphor in ordinary language.
                <p>Look at the following two groups of examples. Can you work out the conceptual metaphors underlying
                    those utterances?</p>
                <p><em>Group 1:</em></p>
                <ul class="code-example">
                    <li>Is that the foundation for your theory?</li>
                    <li>The theory needs more support.</li>
                    <li>The argument is shaky.</li>
                    <li>The argument collapsed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Group 2:</em></p>
                <ul class="code-example">
                    <li>What he said left a bad taste in my mouth.</li>
                    <li>I just can’t swallow that claim.</li>
                    <li>That argument smells fishy.</li>
                    <li>Let me stew over that for a while.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>(Lakoff & Johnson 1980: 4)</p>
                <p>Underlying the first group of examples, there is the conceptual metaphor “Theories are buildings”.
                    This metaphor enables us to understand theory, a fairly abstract concept, through building, a more
                    concrete one. Hence we can talk about theory as if it had a foundation, needed support, could be
                    shaky and could even collapse.</p>
                <p>Underlying the second group of examples, there is the conceptual metaphor “Ideas are food”. With this
                    metaphor, we talk about the taste and the smell of ideas. We even swallow or cook a certain idea as
                    if it were food. What I would also like to emphasize is that the utterances in both groups of
                    examples are taken from everyday conversations, not from literary works. This offers support for the
                    claim that everyday utterances are full of metaphors just like literary works.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Metaphor is conceptual in nature.</strong> It is not a figure of speech, a linguistic object. It
                is more accurately a conceptual organization expressed by the linguistic object.
                <p>To explicate this point, let us examine the following group of examples. Can you work out the
                    conceptual metaphor at work here?</p>
                <ul class="code-example">
                    <li>Your claims are indefensible.</li>
                    <li>He attacked every weak point in my argument.</li>
                    <li>His criticisms were right on target.</li>
                    <li>I demolished his argument.</li>
                    <li>I’ve never won an argument with him.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>(Lakoff & Johnson 1980: 4)</p>
                <p>This time the metaphor is “<span class="knowledge-point" data-visual="argument-is-war">Argument is
                        war</span>”. What is to be noticed is that we do not just talk about arguments in terms of war,
                    but we do our arguing and construe the concept ARGUMENT through the concept of war. Thus we see the
                    person we are arguing with as an opponent; we defend our own positions and attack his/hers; we gain
                    ground when we win arguments and lose ground when losing arguments; we also plan and use strategies
                    while arguing. It is in this sense that we say the conceptual metaphor “Argument is war” structures
                    what we do and how we understand what we are doing when we argue. To put it in another way, we talk
                    about arguments in terms of war because we conceive of arguments through our concept of war, and we
                    act according to the way we conceive of things.</p>
                <p>To appreciate this point better, let us try to imagine a culture where an argument, instead of being
                    viewed in terms of war, is viewed as a dance. Accordingly, the participants of an argument are seen
                    as performers rather than fighters, and the goal is to perform in a balanced and aesthetically
                    pleasing way rather than to win. People from such a cultural background would view, experience,
                    carry out and talk about arguments in a different way from the English, and the difference would
                    arise from the two different conceptual metaphors: “Argument is war” versus “Argument is dance”.</p>
                <p>Not only is the concept ARGUMENT structured by the metaphor “Argument is war”, but many other
                    abstract concepts like LIFE, LOVE, IDEAS, THEORIES are structured by conceptual metaphors like “Life
                    is a play”, “Love is a journey”, “Ideas are food”, “Theories are buildings”. In brief, metaphor is
                    not just a linguistic phenomenon, it is conceptual in nature; metaphorical expressions are possible
                    because there exist metaphorical concepts in our conceptual system.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Metaphor is systematic.</strong> One common metaphorical concept may give rise to numerous
                linguistic expressions; different metaphorical concepts form a coherent network which underlies both our
                speech and our thoughts.
                <p>Conceptual metaphors do not operate in isolation from each other. Rather “metaphorical entailments
                    can characterize a coherent system of metaphorical concepts and a corresponding coherent system of
                    metaphorical expressions for those concepts” (Lakoff & Johnson 1980: 9). The systematicity of
                    metaphor is reflected in three conceptual metaphors of TIME, as the following examples show:</p>
                <p><em>Time is money.</em></p>
                <ul class="code-example">
                    <li>How do you spend your time these days?</li>
                    <li>That flat tire cost me an hour.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Time is a limited resource.</em></p>
                <ul class="code-example">
                    <li>You don’t use your time profitably.</li>
                    <li>You are running out of time.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Time is a valuable commodity.</em></p>
                <ul class="code-example">
                    <li>I don’t have the time to give you.</li>
                    <li>Thank you for your time.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>(Lakoff & Johnson 1980: 7 - 8)</p>
                <p>“Time is money”, “Time is a limited resource”, and “Time is a valuable commodity” are all
                    metaphorical concepts in that they capture the way we use our everyday experiences with money,
                    limited resources, and valuable commodities to conceptualize time. Furthermore, together they form a
                    coherent system since in our society money is a limited resource, which is in turn a valuable
                    commodity. We might say that “Time is money” entails that “Time is a limited resource”, which
                    entails that “Time is a valuable commodity”.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Metaphor is composed of two domains,</strong> a relatively more clearly structured source domain
                (<span class="chinese-term">始源域</span>) and a relatively less clearly structured target domain. The
                structure of a metaphor involves a mapping of the source domain’s schematic structure onto the target
                domain.
                <p>Examples include “Life is a play” (as used by Shakespeare) and the everyday conceptual metaphor “Life
                    is a journey.” For "LIFE IS A JOURNEY", specific correspondences include:</p>

            <li><strong>Metaphor is grounded in bodily experience.</strong> Metaphorical mappings are not arbitrary but
                are grounded in bodily experience. Once established, they can impose structure on real life and create
                new real-life correspondences. For example, the conceptual metaphor “More is up” arises from common
                experiences like pouring more fluid into a container and seeing the level go up (a correspondence
                between quantity and verticality).
                <p>The experiential bases of metaphors and their realizations are both correlations in real-life
                    experiences that share the same structure as the metaphors. Experiential bases precede and ground
                    conventional metaphors, while realizations follow. What is a realization for one generation can
                    become part of the experiential basis for the next.</p>
                <p>Lakoff (1993) lists several ways in which metaphors can become real: through man-made objects
                    designed according to the metaphor (e.g., thermometers for "More is up"), through imaginative

            data-translation-zh="总之，本节展示了隐喻的普遍性、概念性、系统性、内部结构和经验基础。隐喻本质上是概念性的，而不仅仅是语言性的。隐喻表达是庞大概念隐喻系统的表面体现。作为一种认知工具，隐喻帮助我们通过更具体的概念来理解抽象概念。在结构上，它是一种从源域到目标域的单向映射，植根于身体经验。概念隐喻系统在无意识、自动和持续地运作，在我们的语言和概念化中扮演着重要角色。">
            In summary, this section demonstrates metaphor’s prevalence, conceptual nature, systematicity, internal
            structure, and experiential grounding. Metaphor is fundamentally conceptual, not just linguistic.
            Metaphorical expressions are surface manifestations of a vast system of conceptual metaphors. As a cognitive
            device, metaphor helps us understand abstract concepts via more concrete ones. Structurally, it’s a
            one-directional mapping from a source to a target domain, grounded in bodily experience. The conceptual
            metaphor system operates unconsciously, automatically, and constantly, playing a major role in our language
            and conceptualization.</p>

            data-translation-zh="本章从“语言与思维的关系是什么？”这个问题开始。在一个极端，一些人认为语言被动地反映我们的思想。在另一个极端，一些人（以B. L. Whorf为代表）认为语言控制我们的思想。">
            This chapter begins with the question, “What is the relationship between language and thought?” At one
            extreme, some people think that language passively reflects our thought. At the other extreme, some people
            (represented by B. L. Whorf) argue that language controls our thought.</p>
        <p tabindex="0" data-translation-zh="与此密切相关的问题是“语言反映了什么？”传统语言学认为语言直接反映外部世界。然而，认知语言学声称语言反映了人类对外部世界的概念化。">Closely
            related is the question “What does language reflect?” Traditional linguistics holds that language mirrors
            the outside world directly. Cognitive linguistics, however, claims that language reflects a human
            conceptualization of the outside world.</p>
        <p tabindex="0"
            data-translation-zh="这些语言学趋势在“思维的本质是什么？”这个问题上也存在差异。传统语言学家认为思维是抽象的和非具身的；认知语言学家则认为思维是具身的，并且在很大程度上是富有想象力的。">
            These linguistic trends also differ on “What is the nature of thought?” Traditional linguists see thought as
            abstract and disembodied; cognitive linguists view it as embodied and largely imaginative.</p>
        <p tabindex="0"
            data-translation-zh="对于范畴化，传统语言学遵循亚里士多德的观点，通过必要和充分特征的结合来定义范畴。认知语言学采用原型理论，通过围绕一个或多个原型的家族相似性来定义范畴。">For
            categorization, traditional linguistics follows Aristotle, defining categories by a conjunction of necessary
            and sufficient features. Cognitive linguistics adopts the prototype theory, defining categories by a family

        <p tabindex="0" data-translation-zh="最后，如本章所示，隐喻无处不在，本质上是概念性的，具有系统性，由源域和目标域组成，并植根于身体经验。">Finally, as
            demonstrated in the chapter, metaphor is ubiquitous, conceptual in nature, systematic, composed of a source

    <p class="diagram-text" style="margin-top:15px;">Objectivism sees thought as a formal, abstract process mirroring an
        external, objective reality. Experiential realism, a cornerstone of cognitive linguistics, argues that thought
        is fundamentally shaped by our physical bodies, our sensory and motor experiences, and our interactions within a
        cultural context. This leads to the importance of <span class="knowledge-point" data-visual="embodied-cognition"
